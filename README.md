Current Edgecases or things to Consider:

Putting a small plate in, and then another plate coveres it.
  idea: create a set for plats, bowls, or cups put in the sink, and keep them there UNLESS they are moved (not necessarily just out of frame)

How to have the camera live feed be cast real time to our detection

When a plate/bowl/cup stay in sink for >=10min, how to pull the time stamp (either current time stamp or when the object was placed in the sink)

Need to adjust the polygon to match the sink based on the camera

Do we need to show the objects in the sink moving to the counter, like does the counter need to be in frame??
